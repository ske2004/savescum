The magic disk holds the universe, you can change the data on the disk to change the universe respectively.
If the disk is destroyed, the universe is destroyed too.
I think the end of the series will literally be sending the disk into limbo, so no one can access it anymore.
The disk gives you the ultimate power to change what universe is. But it's very
hard to control. For that you'll use devices to manipulate the state of the universe.
