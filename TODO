2. The scrollbar area currently doesn't work with horizontal scrolling.

5. The text editor currently is very janky as it requires you to hover over it to enter anything,
  I should somehow facilitate "focused" elements in the editor. #7

6. Text box improvements: #7

9. Currently worlddata needs to accept a world as a parameter because it needs some data initialized prior,
  The tilemap needs its image, tile size set, etc.
  * Make a "world patch" to change some of the world's fields without altering everything else, then
    the worlddata can return that patch which user can apply.
  * Decouple world from it's rendering and everything else, instead make it a bare tilemap, removing all connections to
    tilesets and so on. Probably a better option.

11. Maybe savestates should be stackable instead.

13. Fix input system ordering going from first sibling to last, it should be from last to first.
  - guaranteed one frame delay 

15. Editor theming.
  I just removed d_colors.um and I intend to make a theme structure instead, could look sweet <3

17. Port the debug view I had from the old UI. It was really handy.
  - there's console

19. Ability to move layers
  - what?

20. Do something with mixing up layers constantly
  - I implemented onion skin for when we only enable one layer, maybe that can help

21. Investigate random overflow bugs :/
  - no known bugs yet

22. Session thing will crash if I load an invalid session file.
  - no error checking

23. Duplicating entities
