2. The scrollbar area currently doesn't work with horizontal scrolling.

5. The text editor currently is very janky as it requires you to hover over it to enter anything,
  I should somehow facilitate "focused" elements in the editor. (Github #7)

6. Text box improvements: (Github #7)

9. Currently worlddata needs to accept a world as a parameter because it needs some data initialized prior,
  The tilemap needs its image, tile size set, etc.
  * Make a "world patch" to change some of the world's fields without altering everything else, then
    the worlddata can return that patch which user can apply.
  * Decouple world from it's rendering and everything else, instead make it a bare tilemap, removing all connections to
    tilesets and so on. Probably a better option.

13. Fix input system ordering going from first sibling to last, it should be from last to first.
  - guaranteed one frame delay 

15. Editor theming.
  I just removed d_colors.um and I intend to make a theme structure instead, could look sweet <3

17. Port the debug view I had from the old UI. It was really handy.
  - there's console

22. Session thing will crash if I load an invalid session file.
  - no error checking

26. The tileset right now assigns ID's to tiles based on `X+(Y*W)` where X
  is the tile id X, Y is the tile id Y, and W is the tile count in a row
  of the image. This makes it so that if image width is resized all ID's will
  be messed up. This can be fixed by using more sparse lookup table for ID's.

27. Investigate weird white blips appearing on the screen, especially in
  the console.
  - Should be fixed by the new sokol rewrite ?

28. Handle overlapping camera constraints properly, make it possible for 
  them to be merged.

29. Add some kind of docking/tab support for windows so to not make it a mess

30. Spurious "Failed to open file" errors

31. Fix seams in between tiles on higher resolutions

32. Investigate strange random freezee when you start a level
